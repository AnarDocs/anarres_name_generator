Generator for genderneutral names 
=================================

On Anarres, the planet inhabited by anarchists, in the great ambiguous utopia by Ursula K. Le Guin, every human gets a random computer generated name. This name is unique during lifetime and thus can be used to identify. They use only these names, no id-numbers, no titles and no hints on gender.

Zrajm C Akfohg did an awesome analysis http://zrajm.org/nerd/pravic/ of the name patterns and the amount of possible names. I adopted the algorithm a version similar to the one without extrapolation described there.

The script can be called by 

> ruby namesGenerator.rb

It generates 10 names for each run.
